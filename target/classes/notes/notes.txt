Maven phases:
when you run any of the maven goals - all goals prior to the goal you are running are gonna be executed first

in order to execute a phase, each preading phases must pass.
1. clean - is going to clean the folder which contains all of the previously built code.
2. validate - checks if all the required info is there
3. compile - compile all the java files into bytecode.
4. test - run unit tests
5. package - packages you project into a desires executable file. in .jar, .war and add into
target folder
.jar files are used for creating library projects, and backend java apps . war files is used to create
web apps.
6. install - pushes the jar file from target folder to .m2 local repo.
7. deploy - This phase deploys the final package to a remote repository, making it available to other developers or projects.
8. verify - runs tests against the package code
Target Folder:
Target folder contains all the compiles code(component test) - but you have to built and write
//component tests. it's usually not a common practice to write component tests in dev source code


how to skip test?
mvn package -DskipTests //--> we can change package or phase ets.
